This code defines a blockchain system with a built-in voucher mechanism. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

Blockchain Class

1. Initialization (__init__)

Initializes the blockchain, mempool, and peer set.

Calls forge() to create the genesis block.



2. Key Functions:

generate_private_key(): Generates a random private key.

generate_voucher(): Uses CryptoVoucher to generate a voucher from a private key.

validate_voucher(): Verifies a voucher and restores the private key.

redeem_voucher(): Redeems a valid voucher by adding a transaction to the blockchain.

forge(): Creates a new block and adds it to the blockchain.

new_transaction(): Adds transactions to the mempool or submits them to an authority node.

register(): Registers a peer node.

sync(): Synchronizes the blockchain with peer nodes.

previous_block(): Retrieves the latest block.

hash(): Creates a SHA-256 hash of a block.

set_authority(): Sets a central authority node.

CryptoVoucher Class

Handles voucher creation and verification:

1. Validation

validate_hex(): Ensures a hex string is valid.

base62_encode(): Converts a hex string to Base62.

base62_decode(): Converts Base62 back to hex.



2. Voucher Handling

create_voucher(): Converts a private key into a voucher.

restore_private_key(): Recovers a private key from a voucher.

Next Steps

Would you like me to extend this code with additional features like:

A full API using Flask?

Smart contract interaction via Web3?

Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) integration?

Enhancing security with digital signatures?
